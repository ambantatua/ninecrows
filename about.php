			<p>Nine Crows Studios was originally used privately to write, hang out, record and rehearse.</p>
			<p>Then, realising the practicality and versatility of what was once known as 'The Factory' and having gathered an array of audio equipment over four years, as well as the know how to use it, in 2012 it was decided to share the studio with other musicians and producers keen to utilise the space, and thus Nine Crows Studios was born.</p>
			<p>Nestled amongst the industrial estate in Dingley Village, the area surrounding the studio is a very quiet space during its open hours resulting in the minimal of distractions.</p>
			<p>Nine Crows Studios comprises of an open mezzanine level studio measuring 8m x 6m that includes the area for brainstorming and chillinâ€™ out, on the upper level there is also a fully set up control room with an eight-track digital recording system and a closed intimate studio room measuring 3.6m x 5.6m on the lower level.</p> 
			<p>With the booking of either space the use of amenities and onsite parking is included</p>
